# Retro-Encabulator-Mk.II
Free (licence in comments of file) OpenSCAD CAD for a Eurorack-compatible front panel for simple display and knob synths like minidexed or mt32-pi. 

Kicad-based design for a PCB may follow, though so far mine are on protoboard (and not Eurorack based, but something smaller again.

Rack 'em up and enjoy.
